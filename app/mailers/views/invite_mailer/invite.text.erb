Greetings <%=@user.invites.map(&:name).join(" & ")%>, 

	You're invited to come and make merry at <%= @user.type%>'s fancy dress 30th birthday party:

	Saturday August 29, from 8:30PM
	at Jaguar Shoes - 481 Chapel St Sth Yarra.

	As a tribute to the many years of <%= @user.type %> saying/muttering/gesturing what everyone else thinks but is too well brought up to actually say, 
	the theme of the soiree is 'inappropriate'
	This could be anything from fashion faux pas to Michael Jackson to a pubic hair moustache.

	As per usual tag-alongs are not welcome.  If someone hasn't been invited it's either because a) I dont like them or b) numbers are tight (in which case they could well be on the tier 2 list and might cop an invite once the RSVPs start coming in).
